# CoffeWithToppings
Cookie: The Cafe restaurant
Here we serve black Coffee for $5, and we can add the following toppings:
1. mocca +$2
2. Milk  +$1
3. Vanilla +3$
We need to generate the check for our customers with the total amount.
Every topping has an additional cost that should be added to the total amount, you can mix all the toppings, say:
Coffee+mocca+vanilla = $5+$2+$3 = $10

Approach to this cookie using the composite pattern.
